### About the Project
Nsibidi (also known as nsibiri, nchibiddi or nchibiddy) is an ancient system of graphic communication indigenous to the Ejagham peoples of southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon in the Cross River region. It is also used by neighboring Ibibio, Efik and Igbo peoples.

Nsibidi Pictograms  have found their way into so many applications in modern typographic expressions, ranging from digital (Marvel with Black Panther and various logomarks), and print (as pattern on fabric, tattoos, logomarks) due to its nature as a pictographic script. 

The Nsibidi Libre typeface is a vehicle for cultural preservation, storytelling, and bridging the gap between ancient symbolic communication and modern typographic expression.

Here are a few early explorations I have worked on showing a set of Nsibidi Pictograms and a resultant set of Latin Alphabet Glyphs sketches inspired by the form of the Nsibidi Pictograms.

### Target Usage

The Nsibidi Libre typeface needs to function at large sizes and also at really small sizes with details that would be reminiscent of it’s origins and would be interesting in print on things like product packaging and logos and in digital use cases like advertising headlines, online publications, tattoos, web pages..

### Information about the desired design category

The Nsibidi Libre typeface would be something in the line of a handwritten typeface, rounded, something in a realm defined by typefaces such as Kablammo, Amatic SC, and Jokerman.

### Conclusion

In the realm of typography, the Nsibidi script stands as a testament to the rich cultural and historical tapestry of Nigeria. My endeavor to design a typeface inspired by this script is not just a creative challenge, but a mission to honor and rejuvenate a crucial part of our heritage.
